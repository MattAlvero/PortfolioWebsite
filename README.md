# PortfolioWebsite
Welcome to my Portfolio Website Repository! This website has been long overdue and I am happy to finally publish this to the web on March 9, 2021.

This website is mostly using HTML and CSS, although it is still a work in progress, I will continuously update this with new projects and will plan to add some more functionality to it. Below you will be able to see the planned items for this website.

Planned items:
- Comment form
- Hidden features O.O
- More projects to showcase
